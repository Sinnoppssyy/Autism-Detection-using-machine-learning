Autism Detection Using Machine Learning
This project aims to detect autism from images using a machine learning approach. The steps involved include loading and preprocessing image data, training a LightGBM model, and evaluating its performance.

**Requirements**

1.Python 3.x

2.LightGBM

3.Scikit-learn

4.NumPy

5.Pillow (PIL)

6.Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following command:
"!pip install lightgbm scikit-learn numpy pillow matplotlib"


=>The dataset should be organized as follows:
